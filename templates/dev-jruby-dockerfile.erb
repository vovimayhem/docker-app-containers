# The following image is heavily influenced by the docker-library official jruby
# image (You can see the original source at https://github.com/cpuguy83/docker-jruby).
#
# However, There are some key differences:
#
#  - Is based on vovimayhem/app:base, which creates an 'app' user and group, in
#  order to run the application with unprivileged access and sets the home in
#  the '/app' folder, where the application code is expected to be, pretty much
#  the way Heroku organizes a container's directory layout.
#
#  - Should build JRuby with DTrace enabled, making this image ideal for development
#  environments. Please note that because of this, these images are not
#  necessarily optimal for production environments.
#
#  - Sets the GEM_HOME directory to the '/app/vendor/bundle' folder, so gems
#  can be inspected by the developer and provided by mounting the app in the
#  volume.
