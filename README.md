# Docker App Containers

Heavily inspired by the official Docker images for ruby, jruby, etc., this
project seeks to generate containers that host your developed application,
running it as an unprivileged user called 'app', mounted inside the '/app'
folder.

## Available Tags

  - `base`, `base-java8-jdk`, `base-java8-jdk`, which are dependencies for the
  rest of the available images.
